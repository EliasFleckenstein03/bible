# bible
a mod for minetest (see http://minetest.net) that adds a bible.
IMHO it was missing in the church mod (https://github.com/mootpoint/church), that brings many helpful items to build a good church.

The bible can be opened.

Right click an opened bible for a random verse from mt_biblebot, a mod that has to be installed. See https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=18086
You must copy the (extracted) bible text from the mod to the (world directory) and rename it "mt_biblebot" (pure text file without extension).
You can easily change the bible verses in the text document. Every verse has to be in one line.
For German users I prepared a document with some verses taken from Luther 2017 named "mt_biblebot-LUTHER" in the main directory of my mod (bible).

I'm a pastor, not a professional coder, so help and new ideas are very welcome.

Napiophelios improved the mod and added functionality. See his original mod on https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18370

To install the mod, just download the .zip file, extract it, and copy everything to the "mods" folder of minetest on Your computer. Then open the game, go to "local game" ("Lokales Spiel"), choose a world, cklick "configure" ("Konfigurieren") and activate it.
Have fun and don't forget to read the real bible :-)
