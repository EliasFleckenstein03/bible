# biblemod
a mod for minetest with a bible
This mod adds a bible to minetest. I thought, it was missing in the church mod (https://github.com/mootpoint/church), that brings many helpful items to build a good church.

The aim is to have different bibles, that can be opened and closed and contain bible verses.
